Software Requirements Specification (SRS) NotesProject Overview: The project is called Example Software Project. The idea is to develop a software application focusing on features like X, Y, and Z. The main goals are to make it user-friendly, scalable, and ensure it integrates well with existing systems. The scope is pretty much limited to a web-based application that includes features A, B, and C. Mobile development isn't in the picture for this phase. We’re expecting to deliver the software itself, along with some user documentation and training materials.Stakeholder Analysis: We’ve got a few key stakeholders here. John Doe, the CTO, is our project sponsor. He’s going to be the one providing the funding and strategic direction. The users are mainly employees, managers, and IT staff who will be interacting with the software. The development team is internal, and they’ll handle all the coding, testing, and deployment. We’ll also be working with some third-party vendors for integration components. As for communication, the plan is to have weekly meetings with the dev team and send out monthly status reports to all stakeholders. Ad-hoc meetings will happen as needed, especially around project milestones. The project sponsor expects this to be completed on time and within budget, while users are looking for an application that makes their jobs easier. The dev team needs clear requirements and timely decisions, and the vendors expect detailed specs for whatever they’re integrating.Functional Requirements: One of the core features is the login functionality, where users will log in using their company credentials, authenticated through the company’s LDAP system. Once authenticated, they should be able to access the main dashboard. Another key feature is report generation. Users should be able to select a date range and report type, and the system will pull the relevant data, format it, and generate a report that can be downloaded in PDF or Excel. The user stories we’re focusing on include secure login and the ability to track performance via reports. To meet the acceptance criteria, logins should be completed in under 2 seconds, and the reports should be accurate and downloadable in the selected format.Non-functional Requirements: The system needs to handle up to 1000 users simultaneously with response times under 3 seconds. Security-wise, we’re enforcing two-factor authentication and ensuring that all data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. The UI has to be intuitive and accessible. We’re aiming for 99.9% uptime with redundancy measures for critical components. The code should be modular, well-documented, and easy to maintain. And of course, everything needs to comply with GDPR regulations.Assumptions: We’re assuming that all necessary development tools and licenses will be available right from the start. Also, we’re counting on key project team members being available for the entire duration of the project. We’ll need stakeholders to provide timely feedback on deliverables and decisions to keep everything on track.Constraints: The project has to be completed within six months due to some contractual obligations. We’re required to use the company’s existing technology stack, which includes Java and Oracle Database. The budget is capped at $500,000, covering development, testing, and deployment.
