- Uses AI to build the UI
- Sample UIs

Prompt:  I'm developing a website for a Resident Engagement & Social Activity Management system designed for senior living facilities. I want to create the dashboard that allows activity coordinators to efficiently plan, schedule, and manage daily social and wellness activities for residents. This should be designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It will include a calendar view for quick access to upcoming activities and provide options for customizing events based on resident preferences or facility needs. Additionally, the dashboard will enable real-time updates, helping staff stay informed of any changes or cancellations.

Prompt:  [Upload whiteboard.png]  Create an UI for this.

- Can use code of a UI in the prompt and tell V0 to create a better one.

- Note:  Will create a shadcn/ui link to install the component

Prompt:  Create a more modern UI for this:


- Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

- Why?

Denver International Airport’s automated baggage system (1995)
- Extremely complex requirements
- 16-month delay, skyrocketing expenses
- Abandoned the project

FBI’s virtual case file system (2000–2005)
- Vague requirements
- $170M+ on the project
- Abandoned
- The second project worked – then again, the requirements were much better

Prompt: What are the main parts of a PRD (Product Requirements Document)? Create a Word document as a template


- A PRD is a good idea before doing AI-assisted programming
- The different steps are essentially prompts

In building this, I want to use open source software or affordable and easy-to-use serverless programs.  Suggest those I should use?

Prompt:  For this program, I want to use React for the front-end, Supabase with PostgresSQL, FullCalendar for the Calendar, Pusher for the real-time communications and Vercel for the hosting.

For this, create a PRD.  I will be creating the software using the AI-coding assistant, GitHub Copilot.  So when you create the requirements for the application, write them in terms of prompts.
