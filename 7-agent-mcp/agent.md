Agent Mode

End of prompt engineering?
- Prompt is more about goals, not detailed descriptions

Creating an app

Prompt:  I want to create a web application that provides weather information for a given city.  I want to use a free API.  Also, what do you suggest for the tech stack?

In the terminal:  npx create-next-app@latest weather-app

npm run dev

Use Claude Sonnet 3.7

Prompt: I have setup NextJS app in the directory 7-agent-mcp/weather-app.  Replace the homepage with a modern looking form that allows users to enter a city name and submit it.  Use TailwindCSS for styling.  Use the openweathermap API to fetch and display the current weather for the entered city.  Add client-side validation to ensure the city name is not empty before submission. The API key will go into the .env.local file. 


Selection:
- Nextjs
- OpenWeatherMap API
- https://openweathermap.org/api
- Register and get the API
- API Key/Weather - df25ed7c0f6c5018ecb2a333681c4f55

- Use Claude Sonnet 3.7
- Create a todo app using the nextjs

- Prompt: In the todo nextjs project, replace the home page with a modern looking to do application. Use TailwindCSS for styling.  The to do items will be stored in the supabase database called todo.  The table is called tasks and has two columns: title (string) and completed (boolean).  The app should allow users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  Fetch the tasks from the supabase database and display them on the homepage.  Use environment variables for the supabase URL and anon key.


# Unit Tests
- Agent and unit testing
- GitHub Copilot can create test cases
- Can't do everything
- But provide a good start
- Different types of unit testing frameworks
- In your prompt, specify the framework
- Chat tends to have more tests than using in-line chat
- /tests and run it 
- tests.py


Prompt:  Please create a separate unit test tests.py. The test file should be in the same 7-agent-mcp directory and named test_tests.py. Make sure all import paths are correct for running the tests. Use unittest for the test framework.
